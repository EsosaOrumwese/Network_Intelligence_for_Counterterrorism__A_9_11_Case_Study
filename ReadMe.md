# Network Intelligence for Counterterrorism: A 9/11 Case Study

**Author**: Esosa Orumwese

## Project Overview

This project explores the network structure of the 9/11 terrorist group using graph analysis techniques. It aims to identify key players and relationships within the network to provide insights into the networkâ€™s resilience and potential vulnerabilities. The analysis demonstrates how network intelligence can be leveraged in counterterrorism efforts.

## Data Sources

1. **9/11 Terrorist Network Data (Full Network)**: 
   - Contains the complete network of the 9/11 attackers post-incident, detailing connections among members.
   - Data Source: [SNAP's GitHub](https://github.com/maksim2042/SNABook/blob/master/chapter4)
   - Files: 
     - `9_11_edgelist.txt`: Edge list representing connections among the network members.
     - `9_11_attrib.txt`: Node attributes including roles, nationalities, and other relevant information.

2. **Prior Contacts Network Data**:
   - Represents connections among the hijackers based on information available before the 9/11 attacks.
   - Data Source: [UCINET](https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks/911-hijackers)
   - Files:
     - `9_11_HIJACKERS_PRIORCONTACTS.csv`: Network data showing pre-incident interactions.
     - `9_11_HIJACKERS_edited_ATTR.csv`: Node attributes with manually added weights based on Lindelauf et al., 2011.

## Libraries Used

- **NetworkX**: For creating, analyzing, and visualizing complex networks.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Key Insights

- The project highlights the structural vulnerabilities of the 9/11 network using metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficients.
- Key figures in the network are identified, demonstrating the impact of potential interdictions on overall network stability.
- The comparative analysis between the full network and prior contacts network underscores how missing or overlooked connections could have impacted intelligence efforts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and ensure the data files are correctly placed in the `./data` folder.
2. The code primarily focuses on data preparation, visualization, and analysis of network properties. Ensure all required libraries are installed (`NetworkX`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`).
3. The full code can be found in `ECMM447_coursework_workspace.ipynb` notebook, while the approach and methodology are detailed in the attached project report.

## Future Work

- Expanding the analysis to include dynamic network changes over time.
- Incorporating machine learning algorithms to predict potential key players in covert networks.
- Extending the approach to other case studies in counterterrorism.
